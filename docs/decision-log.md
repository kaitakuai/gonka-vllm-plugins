Short, factual, link-rich. One entry per decision that outlives the PR that
made it. Full rationale lives in `docs/adr/`.

## 2026-09-04 — Consensus constants in traced code change only through source

A ladder-base experiment on 1×B300 (MiniMax-M2.7: boot with `POC_LADDER_BASE=100`, then
boots with base 0 on the same host) produced honest cross-hardware cells of 15–17% at τ=0
instead of 8%, in both directions and across boots. Attribution and a git bisect on B300
(probe: validate a corpus made by the old stack on the same card, plus H100 corpora)
showed every "bad" boot loading the compiled graph and the AOT artifact from vLLM's
cache and every "good" one compiling fresh. The forced-logits path runs inside the
traced and captured router forward, so Dynamo bakes the ladder base into the graph; the
compile-cache key hashes the traced source files and the config, not runtime values. A
boot that overrides the base through the environment therefore poisons the cache for
every later boot with the same code and batch config, which then runs the foreign base
while logging its own. Verified with a controlled triple on a fresh cache root: the third
boot (base 100 in the environment) loaded the base-0 graph and validated base-0 corpora at
8%. The 16% cells were base mismatch, not hardware noise; honest MiniMax noise does not
depend on the base.

Decision: the base stays a per-model source constant (`_LADDER_BASE_BY_MODEL`) and the
`POC_LADDER_BASE` environment override is removed (cc4507e reverted). Changing the base
means changing the source, and the source is part of the cache key, so the graph is
recompiled. A buffer-based variant (4a6a230, verified on B300) was reverted as
unnecessary logic for production, where the base never changes at run time. Rule: any
value the traced forward reads must be a source constant or a tensor buffer, never an
environment or config value; boot provenance records the compile-cache key and whether
the graph was loaded or compiled.

The same trap applies to the diagnostic knobs that change the traced forward
(`POC_FUSED_REFLECT`, `POC_ABLATE`, `VLLM_POC_DEBUG_TP`): a fused-off boot on a host
with a compiled graph loaded the fused graph. The plugin now scopes `VLLM_CACHE_ROOT`
to a sub-directory named by a hash of the non-default knob values, in every process at
plugin load (`compile_cache.py`); defaults keep the unscoped root, so production caches
are untouched. Knobs that change the traced forward are listed in one place there.

## 2026-09-03 — Seeded-routing ladder base is per model

Validating the frozen MiniMax-M2.7 reference corpora (48 corpora, 10 block hashes,
B300 and 4×H100 validators) on this branch doubled every τ=0 cell (honest 7 → 15%,
fraud 12 → 18%). Bisection over the plugin knobs, the batched-token budget, the
checkpoint revision and the old stack rebuilt side by side pointed at one line:
`LADDER_BASE = 100` in the forced router logits, added for DeepSeek-V4
(sqrtsoftplus scoring with router bias) but applied to every model. On MiniMax it
changes which experts win under bias, i.e. it is a consensus parameter. The base
is now chosen at attach by `model_type`: 100 for `deepseek_v4`, 0 otherwise; with
base 0 the MiniMax cells return to the frozen values (7.1 / 11.9 / 7.8 / 11.8 vs
7.0 / 11.7 / 7.9 / 11.7 at τ=0). DeepSeek-V4 goldens captured on 03.09 used base
100 and are unaffected. Rule: any change to seeding, ladder or PoC math is gated
by the MiniMax golden regression before release.

## 2026-09-03 — vLLM 0.25.1 is the release line; Hopper TP>1 needs `--no-async-scheduling`

The release targets vLLM 0.25.1 only (Vlad's request), so the branch pair
`mixed-poc-vllm-0.25.1-dev` (residual 4ebecc816 + this plugin) was verified on it.
1×B300: PoC 27–28 nonce/s at GPU 92–95%, chat 25.3 req/s (c=512), R 1.08; corpora
produced on 0.28 validate on 0.25.1 with 0 mismatches at τ=0.05; REAP fraud arm
3.4% vs honest background ≤0.02%; NVFP4 boots (FLASHINFER_TRTLLM) but its prover is
non-deterministic at ~0.01%. Mixed batches stay the default (decode-only steps cut
chat from 13.4 to 5.0 req/s next to PoC).

4×H100 (TP=4) on 0.25.1 crashes the engine (`illegal instruction`) once a PoC
batch exceeds ~64 nonces, regardless of every plugin knob (mixed/decode-only,
fused reflect, prefill slicing, ablated math), CUDA graph mode, stream and
collective settings. Chat of the same shape does not crash; 0.28 does not crash.
Root cause not located. Deploy Hopper TP>1 nodes on 0.25.1 with
`--no-async-scheduling` (vLLM flag, node config): PoC 20.4 nonce/s at GPU 76%,
chat 21.9 req/s, R 0.93 (vs 27.9 / 28.3 / 0.99 on 0.28 with async scheduling);
cross-version and self validation stay at 0 mismatches (τ=0.05), but PoC next to
live chat degrades most (PoC 1500 in 151 s with chat at 4.7 req/s, vs 102 s and
8.3 req/s on 0.28).

## 2026-09-02 — Hopper decode-PoC: admission defects fixed, fused reflection

R on 4×H100 (DeepSeek-V4, vLLM 0.28) went from 0.47 to 1.07 without touching
kernels, TP or the PoC math. The hang above ~160 nonces was a livelock of the
decode-only-step rule; the low R was a per-step cap of 134 rows computed from a KV
formula that misreads hybrid KV block sizes. Six admission defects fixed, one
Triton kernel added. Mixed batches became the default on 03.09 (the
earlier decode-only-step advantage next to live chat came from an admission scan
that bypassed the isolation); `POC_MIXED_BATCH=0` (renamed from `POC_CHAT_LIKE` on 2026-09-03) restores decode-only steps. Verdict unchanged in every
corpus↔engine combination (0 at τ=0.05).

Pseudo token ids for hash-MoE stay and are always on; token-id-routed models
remain an explicit allow-list with a loud refusal for unknown ones (03.09).

## 2026-07-24 — First tag cut: `v0.1.0a0`

The repository had no tags, so every downstream consumer pinned either a branch
or a loose commit. Tagged `2833a57c` as `v0.1.0a0` to give builds an immutable
anchor, and repointed the image builds at the tag.

Matters because the package is being handed over to another organisation: a
branch pin would silently start resolving to a different owner's HEAD.

## 2026-07-20 — Validation runs on leased KV blocks

PoC validation no longer aborts live inference: it borrows KV blocks where the
configuration is provably scratch-free, and falls back to the abort-based path
everywhere else. The legacy derivation path is preserved unchanged on every config,
so consensus output is unaffected.

See [ADR-0015](adr/ADR-0015-poc-validation-kv-borrowing.md).

## 2026-06-16 — Plugin + thin residual, not a fork

PoC ships as two artifacts: everything reachable through vLLM's public
extension points lives in this plugin; only the sampler surfaces with no public
hook stay as an in-tree residual. Upstreaming the residual is deferred with no
owner assigned, so the residual is treated as permanent infrastructure rather
than a temporary bridge.

See [ADR-0014](adr/ADR-0014-plugin-vs-fork.md), [ADR-0013](adr/ADR-0013-poc-gate-ordering.md),
and `MIGRATION_FROM_FORK.md` for the per-commit port record.
