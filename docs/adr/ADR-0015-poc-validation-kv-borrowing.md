# ADR-0015 — PoC validation on leased KV blocks (inference keeps running)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-20).
**Port of:** gonka-ai/vllm branch `qd/combine-poc-and-inference`
(052648bf4, 590616ab0, 32fda8c4f, cbe5380fc) into the plugin architecture.

## Context

The plugin's `/api/v1/pow/generate` (validation) path never activated the
gate nor aborted inference, yet its forward overwrote KV blocks `0..N` —
a known silent-corruption failure mode against live inference KV.
Upstream solved it for the in-tree fork by *borrowing* free blocks
from the BlockPool so validation and inference coexist; mining
(`/init/generate`) keeps the abort-everything regime.

## Decision

1. **Shared lease (multi-group variant "a").** vLLM keeps ONE BlockPool per
   engine; the block-id namespace is shared by every kv-cache group
   (per-group state is only block tables). One lease of
   `num_nonces × max_g ceil(seq_len/block_size_g)` pool blocks reserves the
   ids' byte ranges in EVERY group's tensors at once — valid for
   single-group and multi-group (DeepSeek-V4, GLM DSA) models alike.
2. **Sizing lives in EngineCore** (`gonka_poc_borrow_blocks(num_nonces,
   seq_len)` → `{block_ids, blocks_per_seq}`): the frontend-visible scalar
   `cache_config.block_size` undercounts by up to 8× on multi-group models.
   Methods are injected class-level at plugin-register time (general
   plugins load inside the engine-core process) and called over the
   UTILITY RPC — no vllm fork changes.
3. **Worker expands pool ids per group** by the kernel-split ratio
   `r = manager_bs/kernel_bs` (`_borrowed_layout`): slot of token *t* =
   `L[i][t//mbs]·mbs + t%mbs`; table entry *k* = `L[i][k//r]·r + k%r`.
   Physical ids enter ONLY address translation, never attention math —
   artifacts are invariant to block choice (prover and validator always
   hold different blocks; agreement between them is statistical, not
   bitwise — see `gpu_random.py`).
4. **Reservation CM** (`poc_reservation`): per-process FIFO lock ×
   reserve → forwards → return (return retried ×3; a lost return is logged
   as a LEAK — pool shrinks until engine restart); escalation aborts
   inference once and re-borrows. Legacy fallback = in-place layout with
   inference aborted first AND **re-aborted before every chunk** (donor
   behaviour — nothing gates admissions on the validation path, so
   requests admitted between chunks would be silently clobbered). After
   any in-place round (fallback or mining) the prefix cache is reset;
   the reset's return value is CHECKED — `False` escalates once through
   `reset_running_requests=True` and then logs an ERROR (a plain reset
   silently refuses while any block is held).
5. **KV-scratch embeds reuse is KEPT on the lease-None path, unchanged**
   — including its `poc_stronger_rng` skew. On scratch-capable configs
   (KV dtype == model dtype, contiguous — bf16-KV models) the fleet
   derives inputs through the scratch's deterministic layer-0
   K/V-over-residual overwrite; a different derivation lands beyond the
   validation threshold on every nonce (not noise the statistical test
   absorbs), so an honest node would fail under every deployed validator. The borrowed path always uses a fresh buffer
   and is therefore **only enabled where the scratch can never fire**:
   the worker probe `execute_poc_borrow_compat` reports
   `scratch_capable`, and `poc_validation_available` disables borrowing
   on such configs (fp8/packed-KV models — GLM, DeepSeek-V4 — are
   scratch-free and derive identically on both paths).
6. **Feature detection:** `GET /api/v1/pow/versions` reports
   `poc_validation_inference` from an actual probe (worker
   scratch-capability + a zero-block borrow round-trip), never a literal.
   Engines without the injected methods, scratch-capable configs, and
   `data_parallel_size > 1` (the compat wrapper refuses — the DP internal
   LB fans the utility RPC to every engine and would leak/corrupt
   leases) all degrade to the abort-based path automatically.

## Consequences

- Validation no longer stalls or corrupts inference on borrow-enabled
  configs; mining priority and its derivation path are untouched on ALL configs
  (legacy layout + scratch unchanged byte-for-byte).
- Known limits: the reservation lock is per API-server process
  (`--api-server-count > 1` → bound degrades to P×); a mining round that
  starts mid-validation pins the lease + lock until it ends (donor
  behaviour; disconnected wait=true clients are not cancelled); a return
  that fails 3× leaks the lease until engine restart (engine-side
  owner-tag/TTL is future work).
- Hardware A/B (two different leases → numerically compare artifacts) belongs in
  the V4 experiment programme before production trust.
