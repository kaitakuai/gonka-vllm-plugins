"""KV block reservation for PoC validation — inference keeps running.

Port of gonka-ai/vllm branch ``qd/combine-poc-and-inference`` into the
plugin architecture — commits, design, and rationale in ADR-0015.

Multi-group ("shared lease"): the block-id namespace is pool-global, so one
lease of ``num_nonces * max_g ceil(seq_len/block_size_g)`` blocks reserves
every group's tensors at once; the engine core sizes the stripe, the worker
expands ids per group (ADR-0015 Decisions 1-3,
``poc_model_runner._borrowed_layout``).

Safety contract:
    * Borrowed path: the only KV bytes the PoC forward writes belong to
      leased blocks (``ref_cnt`` held by the lease) — disjoint from every
      live request and from the prefix cache (``get_new_blocks`` evicts
      cached hashes on lease).
    * Legacy fallback (no lease obtainable): inference is ABORTED first —
      restoring the abort-before-overwrite invariant that the plugin's
      ``/generate`` path silently lacked — and the prefix cache is reset
      on exit, because blocks ``0..N`` were overwritten without hash
      invalidation (a prefix hit would otherwise serve poisoned KV).

Concurrency: the FIFO ``asyncio.Lock`` serializes validations in this
API-server process, so queued validations WAIT instead of each tripping
the abort-inference escalation, and the peak KV lease stays 1×. With
``--api-server-count > 1`` the bound degrades to P×; a cross-process cap
would have to live in EngineCore (the single pool owner). Single process
today. Mining (``/init/generate``) never takes this lock: its priority is
enforced by the callers' ``_is_generation_active`` spins.
