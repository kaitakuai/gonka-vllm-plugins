"""The v0.1.x prefill scheme, kept intact and selected at launch.

This is the derivation the deployed fleet validates: one forward over the
synthetic prompt, Householder reflections seeded per layer from the block
hash alone, the MoE router left untouched, and the k_dim pick seeded without
the decode salt. Its artifacts are bit-identical to the shipped MLNode image.

``--poc-decode`` switches the whole node to the decode scheme instead. The two
never share a process: the decode stack forces the MoE router and seeds
reflections per nonce, so a hidden state produced under one is not comparable
with the other. Selecting per request would mean two derivations behind one
endpoint, which is why this is a launch flag.

    ``lease`` is a KV block lease from :func:`poc_reservation`
    (``{"block_ids": [...], "blocks_per_seq": int}``) — when present the
    forward writes ONLY leased blocks and live inference stays intact;
    ``None`` selects the legacy in-place layout (blocks 0..N — callers must
    have aborted inference first).

    Uses ``EngineClient.collective_rpc`` (vllm/engine/protocol.py) to invoke
    :meth:`gonka_poc.worker.PoCWorkerExtension.execute_poc_forward` on each
    rank. Each rank returns ``{"artifacts": [...], "rank": int}``;
    PP non-last ranks return an empty list. We aggregate the union (in
    practice only the PP last rank produces non-empty artifacts, but a
    union is safe and handles non-PP topologies uniformly).

    Args / kwargs mirror what ``PoCWorkerExtension.execute_poc_forward``
    accepts. The vectors are already base64-encoded FP16 in the per-rank
    result; we do not need to decode here -- the API response forwards the
    ``vector_b64`` strings unchanged.
