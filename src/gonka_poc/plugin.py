"""``vllm.general_plugins`` entry point for the gonka-poc package.

Registration is declared in ``pyproject.toml``:

    [project.entry-points."vllm.general_plugins"]
    gonka_poc = "gonka_poc.plugin:register"

vLLM 0.23.0 calls :func:`register` in every process that touches the model
class: process0, the V1 engine-core process, every worker process, and the
registry inspection subprocess. The function MUST therefore be:

  * re-entrant (idempotent across multiple calls in one process),
  * cheap (no CUDA init, no big imports at module scope),
  * exception-safe (vllm.plugins.load_general_plugins swallows exceptions
    but logs them at exception level -- we still want to avoid crashing).

Verified call sites (vllm 0.23.0):
  - vllm/engine/arg_utils.py:747   (sync engine startup)
  - vllm/v1/engine/core.py:109     (V1 engine-core process)
  - vllm/v1/worker/worker_base.py:247   (every worker process)
  - vllm/model_executor/models/registry.py:1411   (inspection subprocess)

    """vllm.general_plugins entry point. Idempotent.

    Tasks performed (each guarded for repeated calls):
      1. Set the ``gonka_poc.PLUGIN_LOADED`` process-local flag so
         ``PoCGatingMiddleware`` can detect "plugin loaded but no gate
         attached" (operator likely ran plain ``vllm serve`` instead of
         ``gonka-vllm-serve``).
      2. Install a one-shot warning wrapper around
         ``vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server.build_app`` so the same
         gate-presence check fires for both ``vllm serve`` and our own
         ``gonka-vllm-serve`` path.
      3. Install the KV borrow/return UTILITY methods on
         ``vllm.v1.engine.core.EngineCore`` (via the version-dispatched
         compat shim). ``load_general_plugins()`` runs inside the
         engine-core process (pinned with version + contract test in the
         shim's ``install_engine_core_poc_methods`` docstring), which is
         the only process that owns the BlockPool — class-level injection
         here is what makes ``call_utility_async("gonka_poc_borrow_blocks",
         ...)`` from the API server resolve. Harmless no-op in every other
         process.

    NOTE: we do NOT install the worker extension here -- that lives behind
    the ``--worker-extension-cls gonka_poc.worker.PoCWorkerExtension`` CLI
    flag, which vLLM consumes during ParallelConfig parsing.
